1. About
--------
The Gadu-Gadu plugin provides functionality of original Gadu-Gadu
client extended with extra features available only for Miranda IM
users. Gadu-Gadu is most popular (competitive to ICQ) instant
messaging system in Poland. Now supports encrypted secure SSL/TLS
connections.

2. Features
-----------
 - Send/Receive messages
 - Add/Delete users
 - Public catalog search
 - Public catalog info changing
 - Import/export/remove from server and text file
 - Status messages support (offline messages too)
 - Visibility/ignore lists
 - Password changing
 - Password remind
 - Extended public catalog search
 - HTTP proxy support (uses only Netlib settings)
 - Create/Remove Gadu-Gadu account
 - File transfer
 - Image receving / sending (by Liquid)
 - Multiple plugin instances/accounts:
   <name>.dll or <name>debug.dll becomes proto name and id
   Warning: <name>.dll or <name>debug.dll is treated as
            the same proto and name is case insensitive.
 - 1st user mail & phone used for import/export
 - SSL/TLS secure connections
 - Groupchat/conferencing (Miranda IM version 0.4 or higher)

Note: For secure connections this plugin requires OpenSSL DLL
      libraries to be present in system folder or Miranda folder.
	  These libraries can be downloaded from:
	  - http://www.miranda.kom.pl/download/misc/
      - http://www.openssl.org/.
	  If DLL files are not present plugin works only with plain
	  unsecure connections.

4. Todo
-------
 - Enable/disable features that need more bandwidth, i.e. image sending
 - Animated GIFs support (image sending)
 - Full Netlib integration
 - Voice chat

5. History
----------
0.0.4.0: 2006-10-23
 - Fix: Messages always have NOW timestamps unless they are OFFLINE.
   Online messages won't be shifted in the order even user has clockskew.
0.0.3.9: 2006-07-29
 - Configuration was put into tabs
 - Fix: Some of the configuration items were not triggering [Apply] properly.
0.0.3.8: 2006-06-26
 - Fix: It seems that GG servers now properly handle initial status for GG.
   This should fix issue of being detected by Inwigilator when connecting with
   invisible status. (Spotted and fixed thanks to piopawlu)
 - Fix: New libgadu version 2006.06.21 with fixed some memory leaks
 - Fix: GG now handles PS_SETAWAYMSG without previously called PS_SETSTATUS.
   This should fix issue with Watrack that couldn't set the status message
   for GG protocol. (Spotted and fixed thanks to mruweq)
 - Fix: We were reading from freed variable after new account registration 
 - Fix: Possible crash when closing debug version
0.0.3.7: 2005-12-19
 - Image sending and receiving now uses ImgDecoder if present for PNG images
 - Fix: String fix for error dialogs' titles
0.0.3.6: 2005-11-15
 - Fix: String overflows (injections) that may be caused for example by too long
   translations or too long incoming filenames
0.0.3.5: 2005-10-28
 - Fix: Descriptions beginning with new line were not shown
 - Fix: Groupchat fixed for database locks
 - Fix: Upgrade new chat API

 - Image reception can now be triggered
 - Images are now scalled to their real size if possible
 - Small code formatting fixes
 - SSL connections are disabled now by default
0.0.3.4: 2005-07-23
 - Fix: Connection server config was broken
 - Fix: Password retrieval was broken
 - Fix: Maximum image size 512KB was not accepted original GG client.
   Miranda now can receive images upto 255KB from original GG clients.
 - Fix: Yet another image receive fix, libgadu fixes introduced ghost image
   messages
 - Small code formatting fixes
0.0.3.3: 2005-07-19
 - Fix: Serious multiple vulnerabilities of libgadu upto ekg version 1.6rc3
0.0.3.2: 2005-07-14
 - Fix: libgadu event.c commit version 1.83 by szalik introduced bug that was
   crashing Miranda on image receive, since it was designed specially for Kadu
0.0.3.1: 2005-07-12
 - Hidden db setting "EraOmnix" for being visible as EraOmnix client
 - Fix: Temporary contacts cannot see our status when having "Friends only"
   (Features thanks to JacekFH)
 - Fix: GG thread hanging, not going offline when cannot reconnect
   after disconnection
0.0.3.0: 2005-06-27
 - Status descriptions compatible with MWClist

 - Binaries are now compiled with VC++ 6.0
 - Fix: Windows 95 & NT problems with GetLongPathName function missing
0.0.2.9: 2005-04-29
 - Fix: Status descriptions were not set properly when Miranda wasn't asking
   for new status. This change may cause incompatibility with status routines
   different than built-in. Note for misc plugins (mBot, etc.):
     For avoiding sending gg_setstatus(status, description) twice on
     miranda_setstatus and miranda_setawaymsg, GG sets status only on
     miranda_setawaymsg, also this order must be fulfilled to make GG working
     right with Miranda. (this is how internal module sraway works actually)
 - When reconnect flag is set and manual server host cycling is on the end of
   the list, reconnect will go back to the begin
   (no longer taking address from web at the end)
 - Fix: Stupid GetModuleFileName returning all lowercase characters from
   DLL filename > WinNT, now we call GetLongPathName to retrieve valid case
0.0.2.8: 2005-04-14
 - Server connection (multi)thread controller (Experimental!)

 - Fix: Code of image routines was simplyfied, however needs more care (unstable)
 - Server host and external forwarding host could be specified as a hostname or
   IP number (before only IP number was valid). This could be useful for dynamic
   IPs and DNS mapping services such as dyndns.org.
