1. What's New:
--------------
+ Added back the ANSI to UTF8 encoder for people on Win9x. [Note: This feature has been 
  asked for since it last worked in 0.2.1.2]
+ Added Stealth settings [introduced with Official Yahoo CLient v6]
+ Added retrieval of buddy icon support [avatars]. Can't set your own avatar yet!
x Fixed a bunch of reported bugs.


2. Installation:
----------------
a. Close Miranda if you have it open.
b. Extract the zip file into a temporary folder.
c. Copy yahoo.dll to Miranda\Plugins folder.
d. Start Miranda.
e. Open Options->Network->Yahoo and enter your login information.
f. If you have the popup plugin:
       Go into the Options->Popups->Yahoo menu of Miranda and set your preferences.

3. Troubleshooting:
-------------------
a. Check your settings/options. Make sure they are set properly. 
b. If some weird stuff or crashes happen try to disable other plugins and minimize 
   the list of plugins that might cause the problem.
c. Check your firewall logs/settings. In some cases it could be a blocked connection by the
   firewall/proxy that's causing the problem.
d. Enable "Network Log" and try to browse through it. 
e. If you can't figure it out post a thread in the forums [see link above for Support]
