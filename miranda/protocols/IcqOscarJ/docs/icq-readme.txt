          ICQ protocol plugin for Miranda IM (Joe)
          ________________________________________


About
_____

This Miranda IM plugin makes it possible to connect to the ICQ
instant messenger network and communicate with other ICQ users.


Known Problems
______________

- In Invisible mode, when other side is not in visible list messages are sometimes 
  received twice from some clients (it is a problem of that clients, they do send them
  twice)

- In Invisible mode, when other side is not in visible list messages are not unicode
  aware. This is because ICQ protocol does not support unicode offline messages.

- When synchronising server-list, users get added with await auth flag or receive added
  message. The way which ICQ servers handle authorisations, we cannot do it better - when
  uploading contacts to server account has to be a new one, then contacts can be added
  and uploaded without auth... If the account is an old one they cannot be added without
  auth if they require one. So they are added with flag awaiting auth. With the new
  Manage server list contacts added contacts should never receive auth requests, but 
  if you have an old account they can receive added notification.
