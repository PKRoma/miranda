
                INSTALLING tabSRMM
                ==================

NOTE: Beginning with version 0.9.9.98, tabsrmm is no longer distrubuted in
      a "unified" archive. There are now 2 versions, one unicode and one
      non-unicode archive. Both have different entries in the Plugin file 
      listing and are also separated in the updater service plugin.

1.Requirements
-----------------

a) Miranda IM, Version 0.4.0.1 or later.
b) The unicode version of tabSRMM requires Windows 2000 or XP and will not 
   run under Windows 9x or ME. The ANSI version may run under Windows 98 
   or ME (not under Windows 95), but there are some minor problems. In general,
   I suggest that, if you're still using a 9x based Windows, you should not
   expect tabSRMM to work without problems. I do no longer have access to any
   Win 9x system, and do not use it as a development platform, so it is a bit
   hard to fix issues related to Win 9x.
   
   The unicode version also requires a recent database plugin (dbx_3x.dll version
   0.5.1.x or later) and will not run with older db versions.

HOW TO INSTALL
--------------

1) Copy the plugin DLL into your miranda plugins folder. Depending on the version,
   you downloaded, it is either tabsrmm.dll or tabsrmm_unicode.dll.

2) Copy the included loadavatars.dll to your plugins folder if you don't already
   have the avatar service plugin installed. The plugin is now required for 
   showing avatars in the message window and loadavatars.dll is also used by 
   clist_modern and clist_nicer+. tabSRMM does not need a special version of
   loadavatars.dll, so if you have it already installed, you can skip this step.
      
2) Install the icon pack (see below).   

INSTALLING THE ICON PACK - IMPORTANT !!
---------------------------------------

You need to copy ONE of the included tabsrmm_icons.dll into the plugins folder
aswell. If you don't, you'll receive an error message about a missing resource
dll, and you won't see any icons on the toolbar and elsewhere. More 
information about setting up icons can be found in README.ICONS.

In general, there is no need to use the non-unicode version - the unicode release
is far more tested and works with all known protocols. It also has an option to
force sending and receiving ANSI messages only - this may help with some older
or buggy clients and their sometimes broken unicode support.
