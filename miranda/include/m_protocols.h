/* -------------- avatar support ---------------------

First a protocol must report it supports PF4_AVATARS via PS_GETCAPS, secondly
it will return the following acks for certain events, the protocol must use
ProtoBroadcastAck(), listeners must hook ME_PROTO_ACK, note that lParam = ACKDATA*

*/

  The following ACKs MUST be sent in order of .result via ProtoBroadcastAck()

	.szModule = protocol module
	.hContact = contact the avatar is for, or 0 if its for the user
	.type = ACKTYPE_AVATAR
	.result = ACKRESULT_CONNECTING, ACKRESULT_CONNECTED, ACKRESULT_SENTREQUEST, ACKRESULT_DATA
	.hProcess = protocol specific
	.lParam = 0

  .result = ACKRESULT_SUCCESS or ACKRESULT_FAILED

  .lParam = 0;

  Anytime before or during the ack or series of acks ACKRESULT_STATUS maybe sent, this might
  be sent a long while before anything else happens (or after anything happening) For avatars
  it allows callers to identify status information to do with the avatar, including the time
  before background transport has been created, so that you know an avatar will be exchanged
  sometime in the future.

  When ACKRESULT_STATUS, hProcess is the result code - the value of this is protocol dependent,
  See protocol documentation to do with avatars for what codes are defined and what they mean.
