A: Windows XP preferred (I use it for development and myself and tested on it), Windows 2000 (I not tested it but it should work with may be some glitches), old systems like Windows 9x, ME – not tested and if it will work it will be with limitation (this OSes not support layered windows).

Q: What are third parties libraries required for modern?
A: Modern required engine to load PNG images. It can be GDI+ engine (pre-installed with Windows XP, Microsoft Office XP or can be download and installed from microsoft) or imagedecoder.dll.
