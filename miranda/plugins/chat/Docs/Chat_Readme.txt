My name is Jörgen Persson, also known as Matrix, I have been using 
Miranda IM since 2001 and so far I have been responsible for the IRC part and 
I am nowadays considered to be a 'core guy'.  If you wish to contact me you can e-mail 
me at: i_am_matrix at users dot sourceforge dot net. You can also join #miranda 
on the FreeNode network, where you can talk to me and other fans of Miranda IM. 



How to install
---------- 

Use an unzipper of choice (I use WinZip) and extract the files to the 'Plugins' 
directory of your Miranda IM installation. Please note that you must restart 
Miranda IM for the installation to complete. If you are upgrading to another 
version you will have to shut down Miranda before extracting the files 
or the process will fail.
