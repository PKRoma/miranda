-----------------------------------------------------------

What?
-----
This plugin provides a groupchat interface for any protocol that wish to use it. 
End users need not worry about anything more than setting your preferences in
hte options pages, but developers can take a look at the included m_chat.h for
an introduction on how to use it. Feel free to contact me if you need more 
information on how to get it working.



Who?
----  
My name is Jörgen Persson, also known as Matrix or m3x, and I am a 27 years old 
Swedish student at 'Stockholm School of Economics'. I have no background in 
coding apart from a few courses I took while studying 'Engineering Physics' at 
'Chalmers' in Gothenburg. I have been using Miranda IM now since 2001 and so 
far I have been responsible for the IRC part and I am nowadays considered to be
a 'core guy'. Otherwise I have mostly contributed with graphics to various 
other plugins or for Miranda IM itself. Most well known is probably my 
'Original Gangsta Icons' collection. If you wish to contact me you can e-mail 
me at: i_am_matrix at users dot sourceforge dot net. You can also join #miranda 
on the FreeNode network, where you can talk to me and other fans of Miranda IM. 



Installation?
------------- 
Use an unzipper of choice (I use WinZip) and extract the files to the 'Plugins' 
directory of your Miranda IM installation. Please note that you must restart 
Miranda IM for the installation to complete. If you are upgrading to another 
version you will have to shut down Miranda before extracting the files 
or the process will fail.

The files included in the .zip you have downloaded are: 

chat.dll - the actual plugin. 
Chat_Readme.txt - a brief description of the plugin 
Chat_license.txt - a copy of the license of the plugin (GNU GPL) 
Chat_Translate.txt - translatable strings for people who like to translate 
m_chat.h - for developers
InstallScript.xml - a script for the Miranda Installer
