You need sqlite3 (3.0.8 as of writing) get the ZIP and extract
it to a dir called 'sqlite3' then compile, you'll get a ton of
warnings, like 93 of them - but don't worry about that.

The only thing that works in this db plugin is global settings,
reading and writing, caching and delaying actual writes which means
it kicks the crap outta db3x.
