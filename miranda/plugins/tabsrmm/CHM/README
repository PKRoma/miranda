
This is the source file for the upcoming documentation.
-------------------------------------------------------

It is created with Help 'n Doc, a freeware utility to create HTML-help based 
software documentation.

I've choosen this application because it is:

a) free for personal and non-commercial use (valid, since tabsrmm isn an open
   source product).
   
b) very easy to use. It offers full WYSIWYG editing of the complete help file and
   can output both .CHM files and a plain HTML version which can be viewed in
   any browser.
