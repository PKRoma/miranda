How to translate the send button:
---------------------------------

The default hotkey for the send button is ALT-S. Of course, this will only work
as long as you are using a "latin" keyboard layout.

You can, however, translate the button to use another keyboard shortcut. 

Search your language pack for:
[&Send] (this is the default string)

In the line below, you can enter whatever you want. This text will never 
appear on the button, because the button uses an icon as its label. That 
means, the translation of &Send is only important if you want to assign 
your own hotkey.

To make this work, you need to CAPITALIZE the character after the 
ampersand (&), otherwise pressing ALT-hotkey will only move the focus to 
the send button.

For example:

[&Send]
S&End

will make ALT-E the hotkey to simulate a click on the send button. You 
could even set this text to &E, because the string will never appear on 
the button, but the hotkey assignment will still work.

Note that the autolocale feature of tabSRMM may change the keyboard layout 
when you switch between tabs and this can cause a non-working ALT-S 
shortcut.
