                        tabSRMM + Metacontacts
                        ......................
                        
As of 0.0.9.5 tabSRMM contains support for the MetaContacts plugin by SjE. You
can find this plugin here: 

http://www.miranda-im.org/download/details.php?action=viewfile&id=1595

When you open a message tab for a meta contact, tabSRMM will automatically
detect the MC and its current settings. The small protocol icon in the status
bar of the container will show the icon for the active protocol of the MC.
If you right-click this icon, you get a context menu from which you can:

* change the default protocol

* "force" a given protocol for sending to the MC. You cannot force a protocol, which
  is offline, either on your or the other side.
  If the forced protocol goes offline at any time (again, either on your or the
  other side doesn't matter), the MC will revert to the "Auto selection mode"
  and use the default or the "most online" protocol.

In any case, a forced protocol will be "unforced" when you close the tab (i.e.
revert to automatic protocol selection).

While forcing works, you should still be careful with it. It shouldn't be necessary
in most cases, as the metacontacts protocol will always ensure that its using the
"most online" proto. It may make sense if your buddy asks you to send on a specific
protocol though (for whatever reason...)

This status bar icon is also there for non-metacontacts, but is not going to do
anything other than showing the protocol in use for that tab. If you hover over
it, then it will display a tooltip with your current nickname and the protocol
name.
