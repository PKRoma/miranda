
                INSTALLING tabSRMM
                ==================

1.Miranda Requirements
----------------------

a) Miranda IM, Version 0.9.0.0 or later, currently in Alpha development.
   Plugin MAY work with Miranda 0.8.x (current stable), but this is not
   tested. Use at your own risk.
   

2) OS Requirements
------------------

For the UNICODE version, Windows 2000 or later is required. Windows XP or
later are the only supported platforms.

The x64 Version will require a 64bit Windows XP, Vista or Windows 7 AND can
only work with a 64bit Miranda installation.

Users of Windows 98 or ME may try the ANSI build, but this is a totally
unsupported configuration. There are many known issues and a lot of features
are not available on Windows 98 or ME.

Windows 95 and Windows NT4 are not supported.


HOW TO INSTALL
--------------

1) Copy the plugin DLL into your miranda plugins folder. Make sure that you HAVE
   THE RIGHT VERSION (either ANSI or UNICODE). If unsure what you have downloaded,
   do the following:
   *) locate the plugin DLL in windows explorer
   *) right click it, choose Properties... and navigate to the version tab. There
      you will see the version number and also ANSI or UNICODE.      

DO NOT INSTALL A UNICODE build on a non-UNICODE Miranda installation. The opposite
should work, but is not supported. In both cases, tabsrmm will throw a warning message
when you start Miranda telling you that you had mixed UNICODE and ANSI versions.

2) Install the icon pack (see below).   

INSTALLING THE ICON PACK - IMPORTANT !!
---------------------------------------

You need to copy the included tabsrmm_icons.dll into the \icons folder. 
If you don't, you'll receive an error message about a missing resource
dll, and you won't see any icons on the toolbar and elsewhere. More 
information about setting up icons can be found in README.ICONS.
