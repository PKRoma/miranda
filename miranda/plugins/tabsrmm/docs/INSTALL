
                INSTALLING tabSRMM
                ==================

1.Requirements
---------------

a) Miranda IM, Version 0.7.0.0 or later (released in October 2006) IT WILL NOT
   WORK with older Miranda (0.6 or earlier)
b) The unicode version of tabSRMM requires Windows 2000 or XP and will not 
   run under Windows 9x or ME. The ANSI version may run under Windows 98 
   or ME (not under Windows 95), but there are some minor problems and some
   features are disabled.

HOW TO INSTALL
--------------

1) Copy the plugin DLL into your miranda plugins folder. Make sure that you HAVE
   THE RIGHT VERSION (either ANSI or UNICODE). If unsure what you have downloaded,
   do the following:
   *) locate the plugin DLL in windows explorer
   *) right click it, choose Properties... and navigate to the version tab. There
      you will see the version number and also ANSI or UNICODE.      

DO NOT INSTALL A UNICODE build on a non-UNICODE Miranda installation. The opposite
should work, but is not supported. In both cases, tabsrmm will throw a warning message
when you start Miranda telling you that you had mixed UNICODE and ANSI versions.

2) Install the icon pack (see below).   

INSTALLING THE ICON PACK - IMPORTANT !!
---------------------------------------

You need to copy the included tabsrmm_icons.dll into the \plugins OR \icons folder
aswell. If you don't, you'll receive an error message about a missing resource
dll, and you won't see any icons on the toolbar and elsewhere. More 
information about setting up icons can be found in README.ICONS.
