                INSTALLING tabSRMM
                ==================

1.Requirements
-----------------

a) Miranda IM, Version 0.4.0.0 or later.
b) The unicode version of tabSRMM requires Windows 2000 or XP and will not 
   run under Windows 9x or ME. The ANSI version may run under Windows 98 
   or ME (not under Windows 95), but there are some minor problems. In general,
   I suggest that, if you're still using a 9x based Windows, you should not
   expect tabSRMM to work without problems. I do no longer have access to any
   Win 9x system, and do not use it as a development platform, so it is a bit
   hard to fix issues related to Win 9x.

HOW TO INSTALL
--------------

There are 2 ways to install this plugin
---------------------------------------

The archive contains 2 installers (.exe) files and one subfolder named 
"manual_install".

Using the installers, it's as simple as launching one of the .exe files 
inside the archive.

* tabsrmm_unicode_X.X.X.X.exe       (the "X's" are the version number)
* tabsrmm_standard_X.X.X.X.exe

The installers will try to figure out where you installed your Miranda IM 
using the registry key. They will then install the plugin, the icon pack, 
the various readme files and the default theme(s).

You should ONLY INSTALL ONE of these files, either unicode or standard, 
but NOT BOTH. I suggest that you stick with the unicode version, because 
it is far more tested and offers more features. The standard version is 
there to maintain backward compatibility with Windows 98/ME. If you are 
running Windows 2000 or later, please use the Unicode version.


 The archive contains 2 .DLLs:

1. tabsrmm.dll - ANSI version, can not send or receive unicode messages.
2. tabsrmm_unicode.dll - unicode aware.

copy one of the .dll files (unicode or non-unicode) to your plugins folder and
PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS PLUGIN NEEDS AT LEAST MIRANDA VERSION 0.4.0.0 and
will NOT WORK with older releases.

INSTALLING THE ICON PACK - IMPORTANT !!
---------------------------------------

You need to copy ONE of the included tabsrmm_icons.dll into the plugins folder
aswell. If you don't, you'll receive an error message about a missing resource
dll, and you won't see any icons on the toolbar and elsewhere. More 
information about setting up icons can be found in README.ICONS.

In general, there is no need to use the non-unicode version - the unicode release
is far more tested and works with all known protocols. It also has an option to
force sending and receiving ANSI messages only - this may help with some older
or buggy clients and their sometimes broken unicode support.
