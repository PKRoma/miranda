Version 2.2.1.4  - 2008/04/XX
-----------------------------

	! bug fixes: smiley button visual glitch, group chat option tree
	  icon(s), possible crash with tool bar config, wrong background
	  colors in the message log, "load actual history" now works.
	  - some fixes for font service support.
	  
	* changed button highlight code for buttons with a "dropdown arrow".
	  Entire button is now "hovered" - the old way did look very strange
	  with some skins or visual styles.
	  
	* group chat related options were re-organized. Everything is now 
	  in Message Sessions->Group chats. Options were slightly re-grouped
	  for a more logical appearance.
	  
	* popup configuration option pages are now only created when a popup
	  plugin is installed.
	  
	* small adjustments for minimum splitter position.
	
	- removed 7bit ansi check for outgoing messages. Now obsolete, because
	  of UTF-8 database storage format.
	  
	+ added support for History Events plugin by pescuma (patch submitted
	  by pescuma)
	  
	- removed useless help menu entries
	  
	  	  
Version 2.2.1.3  - 2008/04/XX
-----------------------------

	* for internal testing only (not officially released)
	
Version 2.2.1.2  - 2008/04/23
-----------------------------

	* increased limit of the time based "load previous events" feature.
	  It's now 24 hours instead of the 12 it was before. So the maximum
	  value you can enter on Message Log->Load previous events less than"
	  are 1440 minutes.
	  
	* various fixes by ghazan (compile fixes for VC 2003, msg timeout
	  fix and more)

	* added font service support (patch by Mad Cluster). All fonts must
	  now be set under Customize->Fonts->tabSRMM. The old font and color
	  dialog is gone.
	
	* the menu items for invoking the message log settings dialog (both
	  global and per contact) are now working. You can find them on the
	  Menu bar (Message Log popup) or by clicking the message log options
	  button on the tool bar.
	
	* Removed the Message Sessions->Customize node and replaced it with
	  a new dialog holding all group chat related options.
	  	  	  
Version 2.2.1.1  - 2008/04/10
-----------------------------

	* merged "MADMod" patch. This is a big contribution and adds several
	  new features like a fully customizable button bar and more. Also adds
	  old style typing notification popups (code taken from bio's old plugin),
	  support for animated .gif avatars and more.
	  
	  See: http://forums.miranda-im.org/showthread.php?t=17918
	  
	* New per contact message log settings are now almost complete and
	  working. Alt-B (RTL/LTR toggle has been restored).

	* bug fix for splitter position syncing
	
	* added nova icon pack (by Angeli-Ka).
	  NOTE: icon pack format has changed slightly because of the Mad
	        mod patch. You can still use an old icon pack, but you 
	        may receive a warning when doing so.
		
		  
Version 2.1.0.1  - 2008/03/26

	* fixed small visual glitch when using the modern (styled) tabs

	* groupchats: Fixed issue with indentation of multiline messages.
	
	* groupchats: Implemented selective disc file logging. Under
	  Options->Message Sessions->Group chats, you will find a new option
	  tree where you can select events which should be logged to the
	  log file.

Version 2.1.0.0  - 2008/02/15

	* groupchats: clickable nicknames can now be colorized. Patch by theMiron
	  (h++ author).
	
	* reworked message log settings
	  see: http://miranda.or.at/Blog:Tabsrmm_changes_2_1_0_0 for details.

	* compatibility with Miranda 0.7 no longer given. 2.0.0.5 was branched
	  as stable tree for 0.7 users.
	  
	* group chats: proper handling of RTF \endash, \emdash and \bullet (patch 
	  by theMiron).
	  
Version 2.0.0.5  - 2008/01/02

	* increased timer for info panel tooltips to 1 sec (previously, it was set
	  to 500msec which may be too short and trigger unwanted tooltips).

	* some better automatic detection for the MathMod plugin.
	
	* changed tree controls on option pages to use simple checkboxes 
	  instead of image lists.
	
Version 2.0.0.4  - 2007/12/23

    + added incremental search feature to the group chat userlist. Simply
      type what you want to find and it will be highlighted. Using cursor keys
      to move the selection will clear the current search string. Typing
      something which does not exist will also clear the current seach string
      and start over.
    ! fixed missing checkmarks in the message log submenu of the containers
      menu bar.
    ! fixed untranslateable strings in the container options dialog
    - disabled skin editor for tabsrmm (still not complete, avoid confusing 
      people :) ).
    ! fixed minor issue with double icons in status bar (on rare occasions)
    ! fixed skin drawing on multimonitor systems (patch by Bryan)
    
Version 2.0.0.3  - 2007/11/29 (released with 0.8 alpha #5)

    ! "revert splitter" option fixed for group chats.
    ! "sync splitter with groupchats" option - fixed small (1px) alignment
      bug
    ! fixed idle time for metacontacts (may not work with older versions of
      metacontacts plugin, so please update).
    - removed active status message retrieval when hovering info panel. 
      tabSRMM now ONLY reads the status message from the database where it
      should be stored by the protocol or a 3rd party status message retrieval
      plugin.
    ! fixed F12 hotkey (message log freeze). Will not be triggered anymore when
      holding a modifier (alt, ctrl etc.).
    * some internal code cleanup
    ! #0000214 (accessibility issue with option dialogs)

Version 2.0.0.2  - 2007/10/02

    ! fixed a few untranslatable strings.
    ! fixed "revert to old" splitter option (was misaligned by a few pixels).

    * more work on clickable nicknames in group chats.
    * draw inactive / disabled status bar icons with high transparency to make

    * clickable nicknames in the group chat history can now be right-clicked to
      open the user context menu (same menu as in nickname list).
    * fixed ugly crash bug introduced in .13 (clicking on the session list/tray

    Mainly bugfixes from 1.0.0.0 release.
    
	! fixed updater support (301, invalid response).

	  container while the option to delete temporary contacts on close
	  is enabled.
	! fixed minor issue with [color] bbcode
	! using the own UIN as fallback for own nickname, to solve the "Unknown
	  Contact" problem which can appear when the own nickname is not 
	  properly set.
	! fixed a few issues with global splitter positioning.
	* selecting offline sub protocol throws a warning instead of an error.
	- removed the feature to load a background image for the message input area.
	  was causing too many troubles and people did not understand that it was an
	  experimental feature, thus sending bug reports.
	! fixed problem with freezing when opening a message window by clicking on a
	  typing notify popup
	! fixed vertiacl maximize (patch by SloMo)
