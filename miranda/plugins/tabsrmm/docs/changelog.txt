			Detailed change log
			===================

Version 3.0.0.37 - 2010/06/15

	* changed logic for calculating relative skin path names. You will most likely
	  have to reload your skins.

	* fixed a possible crash when unloading/reloading skins.

	* some updates for task bar thumbnails.

Version 3.0.0.36 - 2010/06/04 - released with Miranda 0.9.alpha#10

	* task bar support (Win 7), removed check for running DWM. Task bar tabs should
	  now work with classic and non-aero themes in Windows 7 (no thumbnails, though,
	  because they require Aero to be active).
	  
	* renamed misleading option for task bar support as it implied to require an Aero
	  theme (which is not the case).
	
	* another tool bar rendering fix - don't use gradients for the tool bar background
	  at all with classic Windows theme, unless both tool bar background colors are 
	  properly set.

	* Aero peek (task bar tabs) now default to enabled.

Version 3.0.0.35 - 2010/05/29

	* taskbar thumbnails (Win7): better support for MUC tabs, set active session
	  should now work.
	  
	* autoclose tabs: converted to a more useful autoclose/autohide container 
	  feature and moved to container options.
	  
	* fixed a bug where installing a language pack could break hotkeys (translation
	  issue)
	
	* fixed "black tool bar bug" when classic windows theme is active on XP or later.
			  
Version 3.0.0.34 - 2010/05/27

	* fixed crash when running on Windows 2000
	
	* cleaned up the mess in the TSButton class
	
	* More work on Aero Peek thumbnail previews. Added custom thumbnails for MUC chat
	  rooms and server windows.
	  
	* updated msglog mark read code with some recent changes for srmm.
	

Version 3.0.0.33 - 2010/05/22

	* some issues fixed

	* improved compatibility for old (TabSRMM 2) skins

	* preliminary support for large status icons on the Windows 7 task bar (Miranda 0.9
	  required).

	* option to show avatars on task bar added to container settings (only
	  when running on Windows 7).

	* option to enable/disable Windows 7 task bar features removed (now always on, 
	  when running on Windows 7).
	  
	* Added aero peek for the Windows 7 task bar. Per tab thumbnails are partially
	  implemented, so you get a similar UI as seen in other tabbed applications
	  under Windows 7 (IE 8, Opera 10, for example). Still experimental, so it is 
	  disabled by default (Message Sessions->Advanced tweaks is where you can enable
	  it). A Restart is required.


Version 3.0.0.32 - 2010/05/16

	* menu bar is now using tool bar colors when using custom message window 
	  colors
	
	* fixed changelog URL for users of updater plugin and created new online 
	  change log for TabSRMM 3 development versions

	* added separate translation for default container name (avoid using common
	  translation for "default").

Version 3.0.0.31 - 2010/05/xx

	* fixed drawing problem with animated info panel avatars 
	
	* moved all legacy color settings to font service
	
	* added theme support for new color settings (+ updated theme version to
	  v5).
	  
	* fixed issue with own nickname when it has not been set on the protocol's
	  option page (use own UID instead).
	  
	  	  
Version 3.0.0.30 - 2010/05/12

	* MUC: replaced (non working) log truncating with log rotation. Old log files
	  are archived when the size exceeds the maximum allowed length for a single
	  channel log file.
	  
	* updated some dialogs to make more space for translations.
	
	* added UI button for quickly opening the MUC logs base folder.
	
	* implemented right and middle click actions for side bar buttons (close/context
	  menu)
	  
	  
Version 3.0.0.29 - 2010/05/11

	* fixed a number of drawing problems
	
	* DB tweak to force tool bar always use visual styles
