View CHANGELOG.OLD to see pre-1.0 relevant changes. Version 1.0.0.0 was declared
splitted from trunk and declared as "stable" branch 2006/07/30. Released to
the file listing the same day.

Version 2.0.x.x was released in October 2007 and is the current "stable" version.
It NEEDS Miranda 0.7.x and will not work on older versions.

Version 2.0.0.4  - 2007/12/10

        + added incremental search feature to the group chat userlist. Simple
          type what you want to find and it will be highlighted. Using cursor keys
          to move the selection will clear the current search string.

Version 2.0.0.3  - 2007/11/29

        * changed per contact filter system in group chats
        ! "revert splitter" option fixed for group chats.
        ! "sync splitter with groupchats" option - fixed small (1px) alignment
          bug
        ! fixed idle time for metacontacts (may not work with older versions of
          metacontacts plugin, so please update).
        - removed active status message retrieval when hovering info panel. 
          tabSRMM now ONLY reads the status message from the database where it
          should be stored by the protocol or a 3rd party status message retrieval
          plugin.
        ! fixed F12 hotkey (message log freeze). Will not be triggered anymore when
          holding a modifier (alt, ctrl etc.).
        * some internal code cleanup
        ! #0000214 (accessibility issue with option dialogs)

Version 2.0.0.2  - 2007/10/02

        ! fixed a few untranslatable strings.
        ! fixed "revert to old" splitter option (was misaligned by a few pixels).
          (issue # 0000024)
        * cleaned up "clickable nicks code" (groupchats, patch by ghazan).

Version 2.0.0.1  - re-upload to enable updater support

Version 2.0.0.0  - 2007/10/02

        * compatible ONLY with Miranda 0.7
        * UTF-8 message storage now supported
        * many bug fixes
        * see online changelog at http://miranda.or.at/tabsrmm/tabsrmm-changelog/
          for more detailed history.

Version 1.1.0.16 - 2007/01/20

        * bugfixes
        * 3-way message log selection added to the user preferences dialog.
        * fixed problem with calling certain protocol services too early.
        * fixed own nickname not showing in template editor.

Version 1.1.0.14 - 2006/12/06

        * more work on clickable nicknames in group chats.
        * draw inactive / disabled status bar icons with high transparency to make
          them appear "dimmed". Less confusing than constantly disappearing/jumping
          icons in the status bar.
        * clickable nicknames in the group chat history can now be right-clicked to
          open the user context menu (same menu as in nickname list).
        * fixed ugly crash bug introduced in .13 (clicking on the session list/tray
          icon).

    Mainly bugfixes from 1.0.0.0 release.

	  container while the option to delete temporary contacts on close
	  is enabled.
	! fixed minor issue with [color] bbcode
	! using the own UIN as fallback for own nickname, to solve the "Unknown
	  Contact" problem which can appear when the own nickname is not 
	  properly set.
	! fixed a few issues with global splitter positioning.
	* selecting offline sub protocol throws a warning instead of an error.
	- removed the feature to load a background image for the message input area.
	  was causing too many troubles and people did not understand that it was an
	  experimental feature, thus sending bug reports.
	! fixed problem with freezing when opening a message window by clicking on a
	  typing notify popup
	! fixed vertiacl maximize (patch by SloMo)
