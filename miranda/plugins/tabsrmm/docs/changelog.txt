				    ================
+ : new feature
* : changed
! : bugfix						
- : feature removed or disabled because of pending bugs

View CHANGELOG.OLD to see pre-1.0 relevant changes. Version 1.0.0.0 was declared
splitted from trunk and declared as "stable" branch 2006/07/30. Released to
the file listing the same day.

Trunk is now using version numbers 1.1.0.x until the next major release. Bugfixes
will be backported to stable branch, new features will only go into trunk.

Version 2.0.0.3  - 2007/11/29

        * changed per contact filter system in group chats
        * "revert splitter" option fixed for group chats.
        * "sync splitter with groupchats" option - fixed small (1px) alignment
          bug
        * fixed idle time for metacontacts (may not work with older versions of
          metacontacts plugin, so please update).
        * removed active status message retrieval when hovering info panel. 
          tabSRMM now ONLY reads the status message from the database where it
          should be stored by the protocol or 3rd party status message retrieval
          plugin.

Version 2.0.0.2  - 2007/10/02

        * fixed a few untranslatable strings.
        * fixed "revert to old" splitter option (was misaligned by a few pixels).
          (issue # 0000024)
        * cleaned up "clickable nicks code" (groupchats, patch by ghazan).

Version 2.0.0.1  - re-upload to enable updater support

Version 2.0.0.0  - 2007/10/02

        * compatible ONLY with Miranda 0.7
        * UTF-8 message storage now supported
        * many bug fixes

          via IcoLib plugin or new Miranda 0.7 core).

Version 1.1.0.14 - 2006/12/06

        * more work on clickable nicknames in group chats.
        * draw inactive / disabled status bar icons with high transparency to make

        * clickable nicknames in the group chat history can now be right-clicked to
          open the user context menu (same menu as in nickname list).

          icon).
