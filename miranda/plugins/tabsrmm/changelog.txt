			 ============================================
						
*) ALT-S not working properly for everyone (will look into it).

*) creating tabs in the background may steal focus from the active window. Annyoing...
   problem is not yet found, since this happens rarely and is hard to reproduce.

        
                         T O D O
                         =======
                         
This list is imcomplete, but contains a few important things left.

        * better error handling for timeouts and other sending errors.
        
        * add a menu bar to the message window to get the options and settings more
          centralized. However, the menu bar needs to be hide-able (maybe automatically)

Version 0.0.9.0 - 2004/11/08

        * RTL didn't fully work for the message input area

        * added small 2pixel margins to the message input area to make it look better
        
        * If you're using per-contact message log settings, you can now apply the current
          log formatting options to all your contacts by choosing the option from the menu.

Version 0.0.8.99 - 2004/11/07

        * the unicode version now uses utf-8 encoding to store various unicode settings
          in the DB. No more blobs.
          
        * ability to show the tabs at the bottom. Looks fine with classic windows theme,
          but may look strange with visual styles.
          NOTE: Please don't complain - the official word from MS is that bottom tabs
          are UNSUPPORTED under Windows XP when using visual styles. So either find
          a style with "symmetric" tab skins (they look fine with bottom tabs in most
          cases) or don't use bottom tabs.
          Or use classic theme :)
          
        * New menubar added. It can be hidden (as a per container setting) and contains
          many options which are normally only accessible via various option pages.
          
        * input area is now a rich edit control instead of a normal multiline edit box.
          It was changed to allow future additions like text formatting

        * new avatar setting: Disable automatic Avatar updates. You can find it in the
          avatar menu on the toolbar and in the new menu bar. This setting is "per contact"
          only and will prevent automatic avatar changes, if you have, for example, set
          your own custom picture for a specific contact.
          
        * simplified the font settings a bit. There are now less than before and they
          were moved to another DB module path. So you will probably have to reconfigure
          your fonts :(
          
        * fast copy the UIN to the clipboard by clicking on the usermenu button (second
          button from the left) while holding the shift key.
          
        * Global settings for avatar display added. See Options -> Messaging. There are
          3 modes available to activate avatars per default, per default for protocols
          which support them, or manually per contact.
          
Version 0.0.8.98 - 2004/10/17

        * fixed middle click close did not respect the "warn onl close" setting.
        
        * fixed small cosmetical issue with the status bar tn icon.
        
        * fixed typing notify icon not clickable if char count panel was disabled.
        
        * changed font and color configuration dialog. It now uses the same system
          also used by the contact list font configuration screen. It's more
          convient and easier to setup. You will probably have to re-setup some of
          your font and color options.
          
        * redone the message log options dialog. Now, with the fonts moved to their
          own page, this option page is less cluttered and easier to use.
          
        * changed the code which loads the smiley button icon. It now uses a button-
          icon (if the smileypack contains one). If not, it tries to load the :) icon
          and resizes it to 16x16 (if necessary). If all fails, a default icon from
          the icon.dll is used.
          
        * made the thin (1pixel) grid lines optional. They are causing troubles with
          some versions of the rich edit control. If you happen to get "invisible"
          messages at the end of the log, turn off the "Thin grid lines" option.
          
        * changed the way indent works. There is now also a right-indent value.
          If no indent value is given, a default of 3 pixel is used for left and right
          margins.   

        * ARGH, don't free() a pointer which might be needed ages later :)
          This one was ugly, causing crashes after a failed message delivery.
               
        * redone the error controls. They are now at the top of the window, so there
          is no more need to hide the button bar in order to show the error controls.
          
        * New message log formatting option: Group subsequent messages. If this is on
          and you receive or send more than 1 message in a row, then those messages
          will be "grouped". There will be no divider (grid line) between the grouped
          messages, and only the first one will show the full header (nick and complete
          timestamp). Subsequent messages will only show a short timestamp (no date).
          
          To make this look "good" you will probably have to play a bit with timestamp
          and indentation settings.

        * the message log code now caches rtf font formatting strings for the. This will save
          a few dozens of DB accesses and font calculations PER EVENT (message) when 
          building the message log. The speedup when loading 100 old events is 
          noticeable, even on fast machines.
          
        * its now possible to sync sounds for incoming message with the current container
          option
          
        * improved "scroll to bottom" code. Works better when aligning avatar settings.
        
        + added ability to use "relative" timestamps like "Today" and "Yesterday"
        
        + added option to display date in "long" format (depends on your regional settings)
        
        * various fixes for the rich edit streaming code. All options, including thin
          grid lines should now work for the Windows XP SP2 version of the rich edit
          control.
          
        * moved the status bar to the container window. Previously, each tab had its own
          status bar, which is a waste of resources. Now, they have to share a single
          status bar.
          
        + added EXPERMIMENTAL multithreading for replacing icons and smileys in the message
          log. The option is on the messaging options page and is off by default.
          
                    
Version 0.0.8.95 - 2004/10/06

        * sendquue stuff added. No more disabled input box while a message is sent.
        
        * more smileyadd changes, tabSRMM now has "native" support for a custom version
          of smileyadd. It also places its own smileybutton.
          
        * icons splitted into a resource DLL. You NEED TO COPY ONE OF THE INCLUDED
          tabsrmm_icons.dll to your Miranda plugin folder, otherwise you won't get
          any icons.
          
        + new feature: you can toggle your own typing notifications FOR THIS CONTACT
          ONLY by clicking the icon in the lower right corner of the window. 
          
          NOTE that this only toggles the checkbox also found in the main miranda
          options, so it will NOT force sending tn to contacts which are, for
          example, not on your visible list.
          
        * a small (2 pixel) padding has been added to the message log window, even
          when the normal indent is switched off.
          
        * grid lines are now only 1 pixel in width (they were 2).

        + the smiley button now shows the default smiley icon used for the :) smiley
          (if available). The icon will be sized down to SM_CXSMICON/SM_CYSMICON 
          if necessary in order to fit on the button.
          
          If no default icon is available in the smiley pack, a fallback icon from
          tabsrmms own icon.dll will be used.
          
        * subclassed the tab control to make "close on middleclick" possible.
        
Version 0.0.8.92 - 2004/10/02

        * disabled the streaming thread stuff - it was causing problems which could
          be fixed, but require some more work "under the hood".
          
        * simplified divider code. No need to stream en extra event for these little
          lines.
          
        * displaying message log icons should be way faster now
        
        * fixed smileybutton appearance somewhere in the message log when button bar
          was disabled.
          
        * MSN avatars now update the mTooltip "Photo" page (if present).

Version 0.0.8.91 - 2004/09/26

        ! message log icons are now forced into 16x16 format
        
        ! the message log icon code now only searches the appended text when a new
          message arrives which results in much faster operations for logs holding
          a huge amount of text.

        + new option to limit the maximum number of tabs per container. This works
          only for unassigned contacts (contacts which open in the default container)
          and is not available when using the CLIST group container mode (grouping
          your contacts according to your clist group configuration and then breaking
          them up again wouldn't make sense anyway).
          
          Set the limit to 1 if you want one window per contact.
          
        * changed the EVENTTYPE for the status logging code. This will avoid such events
          beeing classified as "SMS" events. 
          
          NOTE: if you experience troubles with the log ignoring the color/font settings
          for old and new events: This is a result of this change and it will AUTOMATICALLY
          go away as soon as there are no more old status change events in the log. So
          you could for example limit the number of old events loaded...
          
          There is also a new "NewEventNotify.dll" which you need to install in order to
          avoid the "unknown event" popups if you have:
          a) status change logging enabled, and
          b) enabled the NewEventNotify option to get notifications on "other" events.
          
        * loading the avatar is now using its own thread to avoid a frozen main thread
          while loading remote pictures.
          
        + new option on "message tabs" options page: You can remove the static edges on
          the splitter and the line just below the message log to get a completely "flat"
          looking toolbar.
          
        + new container mode: "Use single window mode". This will create implicit containers
          for each session you open. It will completely ignore all container assignments
          you have made (they will stay intact though, so you could switch back to
          manual or CLIST group mode at any time) and open a single window per contact.
          
        + added msg log icon for status changes (global "user online" icon.
        
        + added multithreaded streaming. Now, all streaming is done by a separate thread
          which frees the main thread from doing this. This can avoid a "frozen" main 
          thread and unresponsive ui when large amounts of data need to be streamed into
          the message log window.
          This is EXPERIMENTAL, it may cause other unexpected problems.
          
        * disabled UNDO functionality in the Rich Edit control (message log). It's not
          needed (the control is read-only) and just wastes resources.
          
        + new icon set for the button bar. Contributed by a member from the Miranda
          community. Very nice and colorful icons, the button bar looks a lot better 
          now :)
          
        * more tightly interoperration with smileyadd. tabSRMM now has its own smiley
          button. You can also change smiley replacement "on the fly" and do no longer
          need to restart miranda. The code will detect if smileyadd is available and
          installed. Please DISABLE the button inserted by smileyadd under 
          Options->Events->Smileys unless you want the button appear twice :) The new
          smiley button also solves the "focus lost" problem, now the input area 
          regains focus after inserting a smiley.
          
        * button bar icons are now loaded once at plugin startup. There is no need for
          each tab having its own copy of the icons, since those icons are static and
          never change during the "lifetime" of the plugin.
          
        * its now possible to disable the multithreaded streaming code in case you have
          problems. It's enabled by default and you can disable it on Options->Messaging
          You NEED TO RESTART miranda if you change this setting.
          
Version 0.0.8.9 - 2004/09/24

        + new "mIRC style" tab selection hotkeys. ALT-1 to ALT-0 will select the 
          corresponding tab. ALT-1 will select the leftmost (first) tab, and ALT-0
          the rightmost (last) tab. Maybe confusing if you have more tabs than
          actually fit on a single row.
          
        + added a few pixels of padding "inside" the message log so that characters
          won't touch the inner border of the rich edit control anymore.
          
        * container system menu: rearranged menu items so that close will always be
          at the bottom of the menu (hinted by OnO).
          
        * new option on the message log page: Use Arrow icons: This will replace the
          message icons in front of each message with small arrows showing the direction.
          A green arrow marks outgoing, and a red arrow incoming events.
          
        * experimental fix for highlighting issues when using individual background
          colors. Trailing lines are now removed from the message if they are empty.
          It's still possible to have empty lines within a message, but if the last
          line of the message body is *completely* empty, it will be removed.
          
          This solves the problem which occured with individual background colors
          where those empty lines were actually drawn with the default background
          color (very ugly).
          
          You need to activate this explicitely on the "Message Log Options" page.
          
        * avatar changes: It's now again possible to choose an avatar from the message
          window if you do not have mTooltip installed. Just click the picture menu
          button (left of the history button) and choose "Load a local picture as avatar".
          Note that the avatar section must be visible (toggle it on before), otherwise
          the menu item will be greyed out. Selecting the avatar from the message window
          will also write the picture to the mTooltip setting (if available), so you 
          don't have to change the picture twice if you're using mTooltip plugin.
          
        * fixed CTRL-backspace. If there are more lines than the input box can actually
          display w/o scrolling, ctrl-backspace was always setting the cursor to the
          start of the text. Now, the cursor is always placed at the end.
          
        * changed MSN avatar code. Now, a single event hook cares about all sessions. This
          should avoid performance problems on slower machines with lots of MSN sessions
          opened.

Version 0.0.8.8 - 2004/09/21

        ! fixed a few layout issues with multisend clist not updating correctly
        
        + added support for the new avatar notifications of the MSN protocol. This
          will require very recent builds of MSN and Miranda. Avatars are now up-
          dated in "real time" whenever they change.

Version 0.0.8.7 - 2004/09/19

        * new icon code for showing message log icons. It uses code from smileyadd
          to insert icons as ole objects so the
