Whats new:

0.2.0.0 --

Tag used after a bit of nagging in the forums *cough* suggestions I mean,
this is the version tag of the stable release now, the alpha builds
will have yet another esoteric tag that is unknown to me.

0.1.2.2 -- 

This was the verison tag of the nightly releases for about a year (til Feb 2003),
all the features found in that alpha release, such as NetLib, OSCAR and so on.

other plugins such as the help plugin apparently worked during these versions!
