All the plugin developers, who are too multitudinous to name individually, but you can find out who they are when you download their work from the website.

The translators, who have done great things for increasing Miranda IM's user base, and who will be infuriated that I won't let them change this text.

The media developers, who made the icons, sounds and skins you see on the website. You should download all their creations too.

The bug reporters, who give Miranda IM its quality. Extra special mention to those who helped with the really difficult ones and went a long way out of their way to help me fix them.

The web forum residents, who discover new and exciting ways to break Miranda IM daily and who are the gestalt that shapes how Miranda IM works.

The users, who...er...use it.
