This folder contains translated headerfiles from Miranda ICQ 0.1.2.0
for plugins written with Object Pascal (Delphi)

I have completed the translation for all header files in the version they
were on december, 22nd 2001. Some parts of the translation are not tested.
If you encounter any problems check the translation and for a new version
for the original c headers.

A tutorial on how to translate headers can be found at http://www.delphi-jedi.com
