LSecurity Plugin
Version 1.0
by Christian Kästner
for Miranda ICQ 0.1+
written with Delphi 5 Pro


Description
-----------

Plugin which asks for the ICQ password on startup and thus provides a 
low level security. If the password is incorrect it shuts down
Miranda.
It is only a low level security, because you can simply delete the
plugin to start Miranda, but even in this case you still need the
password to connect.

Features
--------

+ Askes for password on startup and thus prevents other people
  from logging in or reading your history.
+ Deletes password from dat file (stores only a hash value), so 
  that you cannot extract it while Miranda is not running.
