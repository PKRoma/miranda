The units and header files ported to Delphi by Christian are no longer
being maintained by me (Sam K) aka egoDust.

You may find an update port of all of Miranda's C headers including nearly
everything from 0.3a in the CVS 'inc' module with two example plugins.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

This folder contains some units nesseary or at least very useful
for Miranda plugins written in Object Pascal (Delphi).

Most of them are just a copy of the same help functions in Miranda.
