NetDetect Miranda plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This will connect or disconnect Miranda according to whether your modem is
connected or not.

It will *not* function if you use a LAN or other non-modem means for your
Internet connection.

To install the plugin, place it in the plugins\ folder of your Miranda
folder then restart Miranda.

To disable the plugin, either go to the plugins page of the options dialog
and untick it, or delete netdetect.dll from your plugins directory.

Bugs and feature requests should go in the lists at
http://sf.net/projects/miranda-icq, or mention them in the Open Discussion
forum.
