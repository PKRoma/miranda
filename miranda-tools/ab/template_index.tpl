		<h2>Miranda Automatic Builds</h2>
		<div class="info">
			<div class="tx">Purpose</div>
			<p>
			This page contains automatic, <b>unverified builds</b> of Miranda with protocols and some plugins. No more no less. 
			</p>
			<p>
			The purpose of these builds is to allow <b>alpha testers</b> and or anyone who wants to <b>help</b> locate issues before
			a larger mass of people get their greedy little mits on Miranda.
			</p>
			
			<div class="tx"><b>Beware!</b></div>
			<p>
			Before you start using alpha builds, please make sure that you have created backups of
			your profile and everything else you want to keep, so that you can restore them incase you don't
			like what has happened with a nightly build.
			</p>
			<p>
			Infact it is <b>better</b> just to install an alpha build in a new location and copy your profile there.
			</p>
			
			<div class="tx">Etiquette</div>
			
			<p>
			All general rules apply about reporting issues you find in nightly builds, be sure to state
			the date stamp of the build you are using.
			</p>
			<p>
			Also make sure that you are reporting actual bugs instead of changes that you may <b>dislike</b>, if the
			dislike is strong then please create a constructive and helpful response to why you feel the
			way you do.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			If an issue has been created due to a build, then also include which plugins you think
			maybe creating the issue. Also try it with the previous build, a reponse should be like 
			<b>"plugin 'foo' does not work with Miranda YYYY/MM/DD but did with YYYY/MM/DD - 1"</b>
			</p>
			
			<div class="tx">ChangeLog</div>
			
			<p>
			The latest <a href="ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a> is generated to show what has changed,
			please be sure to actually <b>read</b> it once in a while so you know what has changed.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			It may contain useful information that you might of wished you had of read before installing an alpha.
			</p>
			
			<div class="tx">Archive</div>
			
			<p>
			Direct links to older alpha builds are not kept, however they are not deleted from the directory.
			It is therefore possible to get a build by adding <b>"miranda_yyyymmdd.zip"</b>.
			</p>
			
			<div class="tx">Linking</div>
			
			<p>
			<b>Do not</b> directly link to an alpha build nightly. 
			<br>
			<b>Do not</b> release to the general public alpha builds, they are not for general public consumption.
			
			You may link to this page, but only under the provisio that you make aware that the page contains alpha, unverified versions of Miranda.
