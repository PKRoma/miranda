Yes, this is a plugin to implement the MSN protocol.

It goes online and that's it. Change lines 75/76 of msn.c to set your login.

As of writing, it is 7th on the Mirandafeaturerequestvoteromatic, and I'm only
working on it because the higher items are either being worked on by others, or
are dependent on work done by those same others.

It is very much a 'when there's nothing else to do' project for me, so if
anyone wants to take it off my hands in order that progress be made a little
faster then feel free to ask. Don't try to do it without asking, because there
are some important security issues that need to be discussed.
