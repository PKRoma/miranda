
                INSTALLING tabSRMM
                ==================

1.Miranda Requirements
----------------------

a) Miranda IM, Version 0.9.0.0 or later
   

2) OS Requirements
------------------

For the UNICODE version, Windows 2000 or later is required. Windows XP or
later are the only supported platforms.

The x64 Version will require a 64bit Windows XP, Vista or Windows 7 AND can
only work with a 64bit Miranda installation.

HOW TO INSTALL
--------------

1) Copy the plugin DLL into your miranda plugins folder. Make sure that you HAVE
   THE RIGHT VERSION (either ANSI or UNICODE). If unsure what you have downloaded,
   do the following:
   *) locate the plugin DLL in windows explorer
   *) right click it, choose Properties... and navigate to the version tab. There
      you will see the version number and also ANSI or UNICODE.      

DO NOT INSTALL A UNICODE build on a non-UNICODE Miranda installation. The opposite
should work, but is not supported. In both cases, tabsrmm will throw a warning message
when you start Miranda telling you that you had mixed UNICODE and ANSI versions.

2) Install the icon pack (see below).   

INSTALLING THE ICON PACK - IMPORTANT !!
---------------------------------------

You need to copy the included tabsrmm_icons.dll into the \icons folder. 
If you don't, you'll receive an error message about a missing resource
dll, and you won't see any icons on the toolbar and elsewhere. More 
information about setting up icons can be found in README.ICONS.
