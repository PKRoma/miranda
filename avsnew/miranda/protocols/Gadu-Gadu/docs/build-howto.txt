BUILD HOWTO
-----------

This plugin was tested with free MingW gcc-3.2 compiler. 
There is no problem to use any other compiler like Visual C++, 
but you have to make a Visual Studio project by your self.

Before you build it with MingW.. make sure that compiler and
other utilities like "make" are in you PATH.

Build libgadu on libgadu/ subdirectory:
make

To build release plugin run:
make

To compile debug version run:
make DEBUG=1

or use build.bat to make both versions.
